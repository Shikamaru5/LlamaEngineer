A script that I was able to use in order to run Phind's CodeLlama.

This script was made to see if I could run CodeLlama on my computer with my single GPU the GeForce 1660.
The CodeLlama I chose was Phind/Phind-CodeLlama-34B-v2 from HuggingFace, and the way that I was able to accomplish running this was
that I used 4bit quantization, and some slight code editing.
